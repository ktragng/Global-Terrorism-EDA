# Global Terrorism EDA

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**.  
The analysis focuses on identifying trends, severity, and impacts of terrorism incidents worldwide through data cleaning, visualization, and insights.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **[Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd)**.  
- Covers terrorist incidents worldwide from 1970 onwards  
- Includes details on attack type, location, weapons used, casualties, and perpetrators  

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to size restrictions, the raw dataset is **not included** in this repository. You can download it directly from the [GTD website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd).

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing and inconsistent values  
   - Selected relevant features for severity and impact analysis  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualized trends of terrorism incidents over time  
   - Analyzed casualties per attack, types of targets, and regional differences  
   - Compared groups with the highest number of incidents  

3. **Visualization & Storytelling**
   - Created heatmaps and geographical maps to show global distribution  
   - Highlighted differences in severity vs. frequency across groups

## üìå Results & Insights
- Highest-casualty incidents are concentrated among groups using mass-casualty tactics (e.g., bombings).  
- Long-running guerrilla movements tend to have many attacks but lower average casualties per incident.  
- Regional patterns show shifting trends in terrorism hotspots over time.
